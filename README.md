# AI Techniques for Games

## Project Overview
This project, developed for the Building Game AI course (CSC584), involves various AI techniques used in games like movement,path finding, path following, decision trees.

## Sections:
### Section 1:
This section contains an intro to the SFML library of C++ and setting up a basic game window with our sprite.
### Section2:
This section contains various steering behaviours like arrive, align, wander, velocity-matching, collision detection and avoidance and an implementation of boids flocking algorithm in the end.
### Section2:
This section contains implementation shortest path finding algorithms between 2 points and their performance comparision. The 2 algorithms used are dijkstras and A*
